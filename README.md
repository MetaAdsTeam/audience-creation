## 3. About **Audiences**

As you noticed, when creating an **audience**, there is a choice of rules. There are several of them: *User transactions min, User balance min, Average transaction min, First user transaction, Last user transaction, Minimal transaction, Maximum transaction, User geo-position, Usertoken balance min*. Selecting any rule from this list means that the **audience** is intended for specific users.

That is:

**User transactions min** - the rule will work if  user has made at least transactions using current wallet.

**User balance min** - the rule will work if user has at least ...ETH on wallet.

**Average transaction min** - the rule will work if the average amount of user transactions is more than ...ETH.

**First user transaction** - the rule will work if the user's first transaction was made more than days ago.

**Last user transaction** - the rule will work if the user's last transaction was made less than days ago.

**Minimal transaction** - the rule will work if the minimal user transactions is greater than ...ETH.

**Maximum transaction** - the rule will work if the maximal user transactions is greater than ...ETH.

**User geo-position** - the rule will work if user watching content from chosen countries.
